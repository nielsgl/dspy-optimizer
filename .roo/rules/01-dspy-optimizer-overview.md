Here is the distilled, most important element for developers to always keep in mind about the DSPy Optimizer library:

---

## **Core Principle: One Object, Any File**

The **DSPy Optimizer library** is built around a single goal:

**"Given a couple examples and an initial prompt, iteratively refine the prompt until it works for all samples without overfitting."**

### **Key Concepts**

_TBD_

---

## **Always Remember:**

* **Consistency**: Same patterns for any file type.
* **Composability**: Natural flow of optimization steps.
* **Extensibility**: Easily add support for new optimization strategies or data types.

> **"If your new code isn't consistent, composable, and extensible, reconsider it!"**
